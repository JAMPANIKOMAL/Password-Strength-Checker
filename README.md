## üì¶ Installation and Setup

This is a client-side application, so setting it up is straightforward.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Password-Strength-Checker.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Password-Strength-Checker.git)
    cd Password-Strength-Checker
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username).

2.  **Download jQuery:**
    Download the minified jQuery 3.x version from its official CDN:
    `https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.0.min.js`
    Save this file as `jquery-3.7.0.min.js` directly into your `Password-Strength-Checker` project folder (the same folder as `index.html` and `style.css`).

3.  **Run Locally:**
    You can open `index.html` directly in your web browser, but for best performance and to avoid browser security restrictions, it's recommended to use a local web server.

    * **Using VS Code Live Server Extension (Recommended):**
        If you use VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension. Right-click on `index.html` in the explorer and select "Open with Live Server."

    * **Using Python's Simple HTTP Server:**
        Navigate to your project directory in your terminal and run:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
        Then, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/`.

2.  **Toggle Visibility:** Click the eye icon next to the password input to show or hide the characters.

3.  **Check Password:** Click the "Check Password" button to manually trigger the strength analysis.

4.  **Strength Bar:** Observe the colored bar and label below the input field, which visually represent the password's strength based on the rules.
